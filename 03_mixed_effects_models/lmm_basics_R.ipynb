    "\n",
    "Linear mixed effects models (LMMs) extend linear regression to handle **non-independent observations** — data collected from subjects, sites, or units that are measured repeatedly, nested within groups, or otherwise structured. They partition variance into fixed effects (population-level relationships) and random effects (group-level deviations).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | What It Estimates |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Fixed effects** | Average relationship across the whole population — the coefficients you interpret and report |\n",
    "| **Random intercepts** | How much each group's baseline differs from the population average |\n",
    "| **Random slopes** | How much each group's response to a predictor differs from the population average |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When do you need a mixed model?**  \n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using repeated measures ANOVA instead of LMM**  \n",
    "Repeated measures ANOVA cannot handle missing data, unbalanced designs, or continuous time. LMMs handle all of these naturally and are more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Fitting random slopes without sufficient data**  \n",
    "Random slopes require enough observations per group to reliably estimate group-level variance. Aim for at least 5-6 groups with 3-4+ observations per group per condition. Singular fit warnings often mean the random effects structure is too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mixing up REML and ML**  \n",
    "Use `REML = TRUE` for final models and variance component estimates. Use `REML = FALSE` when comparing models with different fixed effects via likelihood ratio tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Singular fit warnings**  \n",
    "A singular fit means one or more random effect variances are estimated at the boundary (zero or perfect correlation). Simplify the random effects structure — often by dropping the random slope or uncorrelating it with `||`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Reporting only marginal R²**  \n",
    "Always report both marginal R² (fixed effects only) and conditional R² (fixed + random effects). They tell different stories about where explained variance comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Not checking random effects normality**  \n",
    "Caterpillar plots should show approximately normally distributed BLUPs. Outlier groups or heavy tails suggest model misspecification or influential observations at the group level.\n",
