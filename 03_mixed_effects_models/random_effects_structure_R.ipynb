    "Random effects structure is the most consequential and most commonly misspecified aspect of mixed models. Getting it wrong in either direction causes problems: too little structure inflates type I error; too much structure produces singular fits and unreliable estimates.\n",

    "1. How to identify the correct grouping structure from your study design\n",
    "2. Nested vs. crossed random effects — what the difference is and how to specify each\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Using non-unique lower-level IDs in nested designs**  \n",

    "**2. Including random slopes for predictors that don't vary within groups**  \n",
    "A random slope for a predictor is only estimable if that predictor varies within at least some groups. If treatment is applied at the site level (one value per site), you cannot estimate a by-site random slope for treatment.\n",

    "Singular fits indicate the model is more complex than the data support. Do not report results from a singular model without acknowledging and addressing the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Simplifying random effects to improve fixed effect significance**  \n",
    "Choosing a simpler random effects structure because it makes a fixed effect significant is p-hacking. Random effects structure should be determined by the design, not by which structure gives the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Not reporting variance components**  \n",
    "Variance components are scientifically informative — they tell readers how much grouping matters in the data. Always report random effect SDs alongside fixed effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Conflating random effects and fixed effects for groups**  \n",
    "If you have a small number of groups (< 5) and want to make inferences about specific group differences, use fixed effects. Random effects are appropriate when groups are a sample from a larger population of possible groups.\n",
