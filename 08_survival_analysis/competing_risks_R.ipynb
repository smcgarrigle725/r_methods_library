    "\n",
    "**1. Treating competing events as censoring in KM**  \n",
    "This is the most widespread error in survival analysis with multiple failure causes. It always produces an upwardly biased cumulative incidence estimate. Use `cuminc()` for absolute risk estimation whenever competing risks are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Confusing cause-specific HRs and Fine-Gray SHRs**  \n",
    "These answer different questions. Cause-specific HR: mechanistic — what is the rate of cause k conditional on being event-free? Fine-Gray SHR: prognostic — what is the absolute risk of cause k over time? For clinical decision-making and absolute risk prediction, Fine-Gray is preferred. For aetiological questions, cause-specific models are more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Reporting only the event of interest without showing the competing risk**  \n",
    "Always show CIFs for all competing causes simultaneously. A very high competing risk can make the event of interest appear rare not because it is truly rare but because subjects are failing from other causes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Checking proportional hazards only for the cause of interest**  \n",
    "In Fine-Gray models, the subdistribution proportional hazards assumption should be checked for all covariates. Use `crr()` residuals or plot the log(-log(1-CIF)) vs. log(time) for categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Using competing risks analysis without a clear pre-specified primary cause**  \n",
    "Competing risks analysis requires deciding a priori which cause is primary and which are competing. Post-hoc selection of the cause that produces the most significant result is a form of p-hacking.\n",
