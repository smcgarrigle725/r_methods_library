    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard residuals are not meaningful for GLMMs, zero-inflated models, or survival models — the residuals don't follow a known reference distribution. **DHARMa** solves this by creating scaled residuals through simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate n datasets from the fitted model\n",
    "2. For each observation, compute the empirical CDF of simulated values\n",
    "3. The scaled residual = the quantile of the observed value in that CDF\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model is correctly specified, scaled residuals follow a **uniform distribution on [0,1]** regardless of the error family. This gives a single unified diagnostic framework for any model type.\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using raw residuals from GLMMs for normality checks**  \n",
    "Raw residuals from a Poisson GLMM are not expected to be normally distributed — that is a property of the Gaussian family only. Applying `shapiro.test()` or a Q-Q plot to raw GLMM residuals is meaningless. Always use DHARMa's simulation-based scaled residuals, which are uniform under correct specification regardless of the error family.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using too few simulations (n_sim)**  \n",
    "With only 50–100 simulations, the empirical CDF is noisy and the KS test has low power. Use at least n=250; n=500–1000 for publication-quality diagnostics. The test statistics stabilise around n=500.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ignoring the residuals-vs-predictor plots after fixing dispersion**  \n",
    "Correcting overdispersion with a negative binomial often resolves the QQ plot, but residual structure against predictors (non-linearity, threshold effects) can remain. Always check `plotResiduals()` against each covariate after fitting the corrected model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Concluding the model is correct because DHARMa tests are non-significant**  \n",
    "Non-significant DHARMa tests mean no detected violations — not that the model is correctly specified. Model correctness depends on structural assumptions (right covariates, right link function, correct random effects structure) that DHARMa cannot evaluate. Use DHARMa alongside AIC comparison and domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Not re-running DHARMa after changing the random effects structure**  \n",
    "Over- or under-specified random effects (e.g. missing a grouping level, or an unnecessary slope term) can appear as residual structure in DHARMa output. After any change to the random effects structure — adding a crossed effect, switching from (1|site) to (1+nitrate|site) — rerun the full DHARMa diagnostic suite.\n",
