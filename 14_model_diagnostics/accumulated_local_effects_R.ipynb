    "ALE plots are a bias-corrected alternative to PDPs for datasets with correlated features. Where PDPs marginalise over the full distribution of other features — creating unrealistic combinations — ALE computes local effects within narrow intervals of the target feature, using only observations that actually have values in that range.\n",

    "**When PDPs mislead:** If nitrate and phosphorus are correlated (r=0.85), the PDP for nitrate evaluates at low nitrate + high phosphorus (never observed in training data). ALE avoids this by conditioning on the local neighbourhood of each feature value.\n",

    "**ALE y-axis:** ALE values are centred so they sum to zero. An ALE of +2 at x=8 means: for observations near x=8, the feature increases predicted richness by ~2 units relative to the average effect across all values.\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using PDPs when features are correlated and concluding ALE is unnecessary**  \n",
    "The bias in PDPs from correlated features is silent — the plot looks perfectly normal; there is no visual indicator that the curve reflects unrealistic data combinations. For any dataset where predictors have |r| > 0.5, always compare ALE and PDP and report the difference. If they agree, correlation did not bias the PDP. If they disagree substantially, report ALE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Interpreting ALE y-axis values as predicted responses**  \n",
    "ALE values are centred effects — they represent deviations from the mean prediction, not the prediction itself. An ALE of +3 for nitrate=8 means: near this value, the prediction is about 3 units above the average prediction, not that the predicted richness is 3. Always label the y-axis clearly as \"effect relative to mean\" and state the mean prediction separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Computing ALE on sparse regions of the feature distribution**  \n",
    "ALE uses local differences within narrow intervals. In sparse regions (e.g. tails of the distribution), intervals contain few observations and the estimated local effect is noisy. Always overlay a rug plot of observed values and interpret ALE estimates in data-sparse regions with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Using 2D ALE to infer interaction strength without a formal test**  \n",
    "A 2D ALE plot that appears non-flat does not confirm a statistically significant interaction — it may reflect noise in sparse cells. For formal interaction testing, use the H-statistic (`iml::Interaction$new()`) which provides a summary statistic for the proportion of variance explained by interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Applying ALE to linear models and expecting different results from PDPs**  \n",
    "For linear models, ALE and PDP produce identical results — the linearity means local and global effects are the same, and there is no extrapolation bias. ALE provides its largest advantage over PDPs for non-linear, tree-based models with correlated features.\n",
