    "\n",
    "An **outlier** has an unusual response value. A **high-leverage point** has an unusual predictor value (far from the centroid of X). An **influential observation** combines both — it has high leverage AND a large residual, meaning it substantially changes the fitted model when removed.\n",

    "| Measure | Formula | Threshold | Detects |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Leverage** (h_ii) | Diagonal of hat matrix | > 2(p+1)/n | Unusual X position |\n",
    "| **Studentised residual** | e_i / (s_{(i)} √(1-h_ii)) | \\|t\\| > 2–3 | Unusual Y given X |\n",
    "| **Cook's D** | Shift in all fitted values | > 4/n or > 1 | Joint influence |\n",
    "| **DFFITS** | Scaled change in fitted value_i | \\|DFFITS\\| > 2√(p/n) | Influence on own prediction |\n",
    "| **DFBETAS** | Change in each coefficient | \\|DFBETA\\| > 2/√n | Influence on specific coef |\n",

    "**Philosophy:** Influential observations are not automatically errors. They may represent genuine extreme conditions, data entry errors, or the most scientifically interesting cases. The goal is to *identify and understand* them — not to automatically delete them.\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Removing influential observations without investigation**  \n",
    "An influential observation is statistically unusual, not necessarily wrong. Removing data to improve model fit without checking for a data error or understanding the cause is a form of p-hacking. Always investigate first; document any removal in the methods; report a sensitivity analysis with and without the removed points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Confusing outliers with influential observations**  \n",
    "An outlier (large residual) that has average leverage has little influence on the regression line. A point with extreme predictor values (high leverage) but a small residual also has little influence. Only the combination — high leverage and large residual — produces substantial influence. Cook's D captures both dimensions jointly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Using Cook's D > 1 as the only threshold**  \n",
    "Cook's D > 1 is the traditional \"severe\" threshold, but with small n, the more sensitive 4/n threshold flags observations whose removal would change fitted values by a practically meaningful amount. Use 4/n for routine screening and follow up on all flagged points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Not checking DFBETAS after finding high Cook's D**  \n",
    "Cook's D measures overall influence on the fitted values. A high Cook's D might affect only one coefficient strongly while leaving others stable. DFBETAS identifies which specific coefficients an observation influences — critical when individual coefficients are being interpreted substantively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Applying OLS influence diagnostics to GLMs without adjustment**  \n",
    "Leverage and Cook's D from `augment()` are computed for OLS. For GLMs, use `influence.measures()` on `glm()` objects, or the DHARMa outlier test for GLMMs. The Pearson residual replaces the raw residual in GLM influence calculations.\n",
