    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Pseudoreplication: treating subsamples as independent replicates**  \n",
    "If three water samples are taken from each of ten sites, and all 30 samples are analysed as 30 independent observations, the effective sample size is 10 — not 30. Subsamples within a site are not independent. The experimental unit is the site; subsamples are technical replicates. Use mixed models with site as a random effect, or average within sites before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Testing baseline balance with hypothesis tests**  \n",
    "A common Table 1 practice is to report p-values for baseline covariate differences between groups. This is logically flawed: in a randomised experiment, any imbalance is by definition due to chance, and the p-value tells you only about sample size, not about the severity of imbalance. Report standardised mean differences (SMD) instead — |SMD| > 0.1 is a practical threshold for concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ignoring blocking structure in the analysis**  \n",
    "If the experiment was designed with blocks (catchments, batches, fields), the blocking structure must be accounted for in the analysis — as a fixed effect (`lm(y ~ treatment + block)`) or random effect (`lmer(y ~ treatment + (1|block))`). Analysing a blocked design as a CRD inflates residual variance, reduces power, and produces anticonservative confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Confounding treatment with time or space**  \n",
    "Assigning all control sites in one catchment and all treatment sites in another is not randomisation — it completely confounds treatment with catchment. Similarly, treating all sites in spring and controls in autumn confounds treatment with season. Randomisation must occur within the relevant spatial and temporal scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Changing the randomisation scheme after seeing baseline data**  \n",
    "Adjusting the treatment assignments after seeing baseline covariates — even to \"improve balance\" — invalidates the randomisation guarantees. If balance on key covariates is important, use pre-specified stratified or covariate-adaptive randomisation before any baseline data are examined.\n",
