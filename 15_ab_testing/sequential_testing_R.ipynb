    "Repeatedly testing accumulating data and stopping when p < 0.05 inflates Type I error severely. With 5 interim looks, the true α can reach 14%; with 20 looks, it exceeds 25%. Sequential testing methods allow early stopping while controlling Type I error through an **α spending function** that allocates significance budget across interim analyses.\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Peeking at p-values and stopping when significant**  \n",
    "This is the most common error in sequential data analysis. Even a single unplanned interim look inflates Type I error. If interim analysis is anticipated, it must be pre-specified — the number of looks, the timing, and the stopping boundaries must all be defined before data collection begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Specifying the sequential design after observing a trend in the data**  \n",
    "Fitting a sequential boundary to data that have already been collected — even to \"formalise\" an early stop that seemed justified — is post hoc. The boundary must be pre-specified. If an unplanned stop has already occurred, report it transparently as exploratory and seek independent replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Using Pocock boundaries when early stopping for efficacy is unlikely**  \n",
    "Pocock boundaries spend α equally at each look, requiring the same (very conservative) threshold at the final analysis as at interim looks. This reduces overall power substantially. O'Brien-Fleming spends very little α early — requiring overwhelming evidence to stop early — and preserves nearly all power at the final look. Prefer O'Brien-Fleming unless there is a strong reason to stop early.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Not adjusting confidence intervals after early stopping**  \n",
    "When a trial stops early due to efficacy, the observed effect size is inflated (winner's curse). Naive confidence intervals computed at the stopping point are too narrow and centred on a biased estimate. Median-unbiased estimates and stage-adjusted CIs must be used — `gsDesign` provides these.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Treating the maximum n as the expected n**  \n",
    "Sequential designs are sized to achieve 80% power at the maximum n. The expected n if the true effect is large may be much smaller — the advantage of sequential testing is stopping early when evidence is overwhelming. Report both the maximum n and the expected n under the assumed effect size when justifying the design.\n",
