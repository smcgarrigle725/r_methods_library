    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Choosing the MDE to match available sample size rather than meaningful effect**  \n",
    "\"We have 30 sites, so we can detect d=0.75 — is that meaningful?\" inverts the logic. The MDE must be chosen on scientific grounds first, then n calculated to detect it. If the required n is infeasible, the study should be redesigned or the research question revised — not the MDE adjusted downward to match convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using the effect size from the literature as the MDE**  \n",
    "Published effects are biased upward due to publication bias — journals preferentially publish large, significant effects. Using a published effect as the expected MDE typically produces a study that is too small. Use the lower bound of the CI from published effects, or a conservative estimate from a well-powered study, as the basis for the MDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Not propagating uncertainty in σ to the sample size calculation**  \n",
    "The standard deviation estimated from a pilot study of n=20 is itself uncertain (±30–50%). A larger true σ than estimated means the actual power is below the nominal level. Always conduct a sensitivity analysis across a plausible range of σ and add a buffer (typically 15–25%) to the calculated n.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Reporting the MDE as if it were the expected effect**  \n",
    "\"The study was powered to detect a 2-species increase\" does not mean a 2-species increase is expected or was observed. The MDE is the sensitivity floor of the study — the smallest signal it can reliably find. Conflating it with the expected or observed effect misrepresents what the power analysis established.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Calculating MDE for the primary outcome only**  \n",
    "Studies with multiple outcomes have different MDEs for each. A study powered for the primary outcome may be grossly underpowered for secondary outcomes with higher variability or smaller expected effects. Document the MDE and power for each outcome separately, and treat underpowered secondary outcomes as exploratory.\n",
