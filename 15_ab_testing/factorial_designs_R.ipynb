    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Running separate A/B tests instead of a factorial design**  \n",
    "Testing \"does planting work?\" and \"does flow augmentation work?\" as two separate experiments, each with n=60, cannot detect a synergistic interaction between them. A 2×2 factorial with the same total n=120 tests both main effects and the interaction simultaneously. Whenever two factors might interact, a factorial design is strictly superior to separate tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Interpreting main effects in isolation when the interaction is significant**  \n",
    "If the planting × flow_aug interaction is significant, the statement \"planting increases richness by 3 species\" is incomplete — the effect of planting is 3 species when flow is absent but 8 species when flow is augmented. Main effects are averages over all levels of the other factor; when the interaction is significant, those averages are misleading. Always report simple effects when an interaction is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Using Type I (sequential) ANOVA for unbalanced factorial designs**  \n",
    "R's default `anova()` uses Type I sums of squares, which test effects sequentially in the order they appear in the model. For unbalanced designs (unequal cell sizes), this means main effects are confounded with other effects. Always use `car::Anova(type=3)` for factorial designs — it tests each effect after accounting for all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Not including the interaction term in the initial model**  \n",
    "Fitting `lm(y ~ A + B)` instead of `lm(y ~ A * B)` forces the model to assume no interaction. If the true interaction is large, the residuals absorb it and the test for main effects is invalid. Always start with the full factorial model and remove non-significant interactions only if they are theoretically implausible and sample size is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Treating a non-significant interaction as proof of additivity**  \n",
    "A non-significant interaction test in an underpowered study does not confirm additivity — it means there is insufficient evidence to detect the interaction at the given sample size. The interaction may still be practically important. Report the effect size estimate and CI for the interaction term alongside the p-value.\n",
