    "Prophet (Taylor & Letham, 2018) is a decomposable forecasting model designed for business time series with strong seasonality and irregular observations. It fits a sum of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y(t) = trend(t) + seasonality(t) + holidays(t) + ε\n",
    "```\n",

    "| Feature | Detail |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Trend** | Piecewise linear or logistic (saturating) growth; changepoints detected automatically |\n",
    "| **Seasonality** | Fourier series: yearly, weekly, daily; custom periods can be added |\n",
    "| **Holidays / events** | User-supplied event windows |\n",
    "| **Missing data** | Handled natively — no interpolation needed |\n",
    "| **Input format** | Data frame with columns `ds` (date) and `y` (value) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**When Prophet excels:** Daily or sub-daily business data; multiple seasonalities (weekly + annual); known special events; non-regular observation gaps; non-technical forecasters needing interpretable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to prefer SARIMA/ETS:** High-frequency ecological or clinical data without business-calendar effects; short series; when full statistical control over model structure is needed.\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using Prophet for short series**  \n",
    "Prophet needs enough data to estimate its seasonal Fourier components. For annual seasonality with `fourier.order=10`, at least 2–3 full annual cycles (730+ observations for daily data) are needed. Short series produce poorly calibrated intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using additive mode when seasonality scales with level**  \n",
    "If summer peaks are proportionally larger when the trend is high (not just larger in absolute terms), use `seasonality.mode = \"multiplicative\"`. Inspect the component plot — if the seasonal component grows with the trend in an additive model, switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Over-flexible trends with high `changepoint.prior.scale`**  \n",
    "High values (>0.3) cause Prophet to fit every local fluctuation in the trend, producing poor forecasts that revert the trend to whatever direction it was heading near the end of the series. Calibrate with cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Ignoring the prediction interval calibration**  \n",
    "Prophet's default uncertainty intervals assume the future variance matches the historical fit residuals. For data with structural non-stationarity, this underestimates true forecast uncertainty. Check with cross-validation coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Using Prophet as a black box without component inspection**  \n",
    "Always run `prophet_plot_components()` to inspect the decomposed trend, weekly, and annual patterns. These plots reveal whether the model is capturing real seasonal structure or overfitting noise.\n",
