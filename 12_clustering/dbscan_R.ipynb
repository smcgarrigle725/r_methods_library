    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) groups observations that are closely packed and labels isolated observations as noise (cluster 0). Unlike k-means, it discovers the number of clusters automatically, handles non-convex shapes, and explicitly models outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core concepts:**\n",
    "- **Core point:** has ≥ `minPts` neighbours within radius `eps`\n",
    "- **Border point:** within `eps` of a core point but fewer than `minPts` neighbours itself\n",
    "- **Noise point:** not a core point or border point — labelled cluster 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Controls | How to choose |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| `eps` | Neighbourhood radius | k-NN distance plot: find the \"knee\" |\n",
    "| `minPts` | Minimum neighbours for a core point | Rule of thumb: ≥ dimensionality + 1; typically 5–20 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use DBSCAN over k-means:**\n",
    "- Clusters are non-convex (elongated, ring-shaped, irregular)\n",
    "- Number of clusters is unknown\n",
    "- Outliers/noise are expected and should be identified\n",
    "- Clusters have very different sizes or densities\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Choosing eps arbitrarily without the k-NN distance plot**  \n",
    "eps is highly sensitive — a value too small produces many noise points and fragmented clusters; too large merges everything into one cluster. Always use `kNNdistplot()` to find the knee in the k-th nearest-neighbour distance curve before fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Not scaling features before DBSCAN**  \n",
    "Like k-means, DBSCAN uses Euclidean distance. Unscaled features with different ranges will cause the algorithm to find structure only in the high-variance features. Always scale to unit variance before applying DBSCAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Treating noise points (cluster 0) as a cluster**  \n",
    "Noise points are observations that do not belong to any dense region — they are outliers or points between clusters. They should be examined individually, not treated as a homogeneous group. Reporting \"4 clusters including noise\" misrepresents the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Using DBSCAN when cluster densities vary greatly**  \n",
    "A single eps cannot capture clusters of very different densities. If one cluster has 10× the density of another, the optimal eps for the dense cluster will absorb sparse-cluster points as noise. Use HDBSCAN for variable-density data — it adapts the density threshold hierarchically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Interpreting DBSCAN results as definitive cluster assignments**  \n",
    "Border points are assigned to whichever cluster's core point found them first — this is algorithm-dependent and can vary with data ordering or eps. Core points have deterministic assignments; border point assignments are not. Treat border points with lower confidence.\n",
