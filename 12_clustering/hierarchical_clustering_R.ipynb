    "Hierarchical clustering builds a tree (dendrogram) of nested cluster merges. Unlike k-means, it does not require specifying k in advance and reveals structure at multiple scales simultaneously.\n",

    "**Agglomerative** (bottom-up, most common): each observation starts as its own cluster; pairs are merged iteratively based on linkage distance until all observations are in one cluster.\n",

    "| Linkage | Distance between clusters A and B | Properties |\n",

    "| **Average (UPGMA)** | mean of all pairwise distances | Compromise; good general default |\n",
    "| **Ward.D2** | increase in total within-cluster SS | Similar to k-means; compact clusters; recommended for most purposes |\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using single linkage for most clustering tasks**  \n",
    "Single linkage suffers from \"chaining\" — clusters grow by adding single observations at a time, producing elongated chains rather than compact groups. It is useful for detecting outliers but almost never the right choice for finding natural groupings. Use Ward.D2 or average linkage as defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Not checking the cophenetic correlation**  \n",
    "The cophenetic correlation measures how faithfully the dendrogram represents the original pairwise distances. If it is below 0.75, the dendrogram is a poor representation and conclusions drawn from it are unreliable. Try alternative linkage methods or check for outliers distorting the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Using Euclidean distance with mixed-type data**  \n",
    "Euclidean distance has no sensible interpretation for categorical or ordinal variables. For datasets with mixed feature types, use Gower distance via `cluster::daisy()`, which normalises each variable type appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Cutting the dendrogram at an arbitrary height without validation**  \n",
    "The \"right\" cut height should be guided by a large vertical gap in the dendrogram (suggesting a natural grouping), validated with silhouette scores, and checked against domain knowledge. Choosing k solely because a plot looks approximately right is not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Applying hierarchical clustering to very large datasets**  \n",
    "Computing the full distance matrix requires O(n²) memory and O(n² log n) computation. For n > 5000, consider `cluster::diana()` (divisive, faster), approximate hierarchical methods, or clustering a representative subsample first.\n",
