    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE converts high-dimensional distances into probabilities and minimises the KL divergence between the high-dimensional and 2D probability distributions. It excels at preserving **local** neighbourhood structure, making nearby points in high dimensions appear near each other in 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical properties and limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Implication |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Preserves local structure | Good for visualising cluster separation |\n",
    "| Does NOT preserve global structure | Inter-cluster distances are meaningless |\n",
    "| Non-deterministic | Results vary between runs; always set seed |\n",
    "| Perplexity-sensitive | Same data produces different plots at different perplexities |\n",
    "| Cannot embed new points | Must rerun entire algorithm for new data |\n",
    "| Slow for large n | Use PCA preprocessing; or UMAP for n > 10,000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perplexity** is loosely the effective number of neighbours considered. It controls the balance between local and global structure. Too low: isolated points; too high: cluster structure dissolves. Range 5–50; always try multiple values.\n",

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Interpreting cluster distances as meaningful**  \n",
    "The most consequential misuse of t-SNE. Two clusters that appear far apart in the 2D plot may be neighbours in the original space. Two clusters appearing close may be distant. Never report \"cluster A is more similar to B than to C\" based on visual proximity in a t-SNE plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using a single perplexity value**  \n",
    "Perplexity fundamentally changes the structure that appears. A cluster visible only at perplexity=5 may be an artefact of over-emphasis on small neighbourhoods. Always produce a panel of at least three perplexity values (5, 30, 50) and report only structure that is consistent across them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Using cluster sizes in t-SNE plots to infer cluster size in the original data**  \n",
    "t-SNE expands dense regions and compresses sparse ones to fill the plot area. A visually large cluster is not necessarily a large cluster in the original data. Use cluster assignment counts — not visual area — to report sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Running t-SNE on raw features without PCA preprocessing**  \n",
    "For high-dimensional data (p > 30), running t-SNE directly on raw features is slow, noisy, and sensitive to uninformative dimensions. Reduce to the principal components covering ~90% of variance first, then apply t-SNE to the PC scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Changing random seed to get a \"cleaner\" plot**  \n",
    "t-SNE is non-deterministic. Choosing the seed that produces the most visually appealing separation is cherry-picking. Run with 3–5 seeds and verify that cluster structure is consistent. If results change substantially between seeds, the structure is unstable.\n",
