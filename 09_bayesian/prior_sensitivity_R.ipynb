    "# Prior Sensitivity Analysis in R\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior sensitivity analysis systematically examines how much posterior conclusions change when priors change. It is not optional — it is a required component of any credible applied Bayesian analysis, and is increasingly demanded by reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- With abundant data, the likelihood dominates and priors have little influence — results should be robust\n",
    "- With sparse data, priors can strongly influence the posterior — sensitivity must be reported\n",
    "- A result that holds across a range of reasonable priors is more credible than one that depends on a specific prior choice\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to vary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Prior class | What to vary | Typical range |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Regression coefficients** | Width (scale) of the prior | Tight: Normal(0,1); moderate: Normal(0,5); wide: Normal(0,10) |\n",
    "| **Variance/SD parameters** | Prior family and scale | Exponential(1), Half-Normal(0,1), Half-Cauchy(0,1) |\n",
    "| **Group-level SD (hierarchical)** | Scale of hyperprior | Exponential(1), Exponential(0.5), Half-Normal(0,2) |\n",
    "| **Prior location** | Mean shift | Centre at 0 vs. domain-informed value |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting results:**\n",
    "- Posterior nearly identical across priors → results are data-driven and robust\n",
    "- Posterior shifts substantially → flag the sensitivity and explain which prior is most justified on domain grounds\n",

For variance parameters, the difference between `exponential(1)`, `half-Normal(0,1)`, and `half-Cauchy(0,1)` can be substantial with sparse data. Include at least one alternative family in the sensitivity analysis.\n",

    "**3. Concluding insensitivity with large n without checking small-sample behaviour**  \n",

    "**4. Choosing the prior that gives the most significant or smallest credible interval**  \n",
    "Prior selection should be based on domain knowledge and prior predictive checks, not on which prior produces the preferred result. This is the Bayesian equivalent of p-hacking. The sensitivity analysis should be pre-specified or the primary prior selected before examining posterior results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Sensitivity-testing only fixed-effect priors in hierarchical models**  \n",
    "The hyperprior on group-level SD is often the most influential prior in hierarchical models because it controls shrinkage. Always include it in the sensitivity analysis alongside the regression coefficient priors.\n",
