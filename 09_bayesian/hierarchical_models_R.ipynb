    "Bayesian hierarchical models are multilevel models with priors on the group-level parameters themselves (hyperpriors). They implement **partial pooling** — group estimates are shrunk toward the global mean in proportion to how much information each group contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three pooling strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | What it does | Problem |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **No pooling** | Estimate each group independently | Ignores information sharing; noisy for small groups |\n",
    "| **Complete pooling** | Ignore group structure entirely | Ignores genuine group differences; biased |\n",
    "| **Partial pooling** | Groups borrow strength from each other | Optimal; what Bayesian hierarchical models do |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shrinkage:** Groups with fewer observations are shrunk more strongly toward the global mean. Groups with many observations retain their own estimate. This is automatic regularisation — it reduces overfitting without cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key hyperprior insight:** The prior on group-level standard deviation σ_group controls the degree of pooling. σ_group → 0 = complete pooling; σ_group → ∞ = no pooling. The data inform σ_group — the model learns how variable groups are.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Using a wide prior on the group-level SD (σ_group)**  \n",
    "A half-Cauchy or very wide prior on σ_group allows implausibly large group differences and reduces shrinkage. `exponential(1)` or `half-Normal(0, 1)` on the SD scale appropriate for the outcome is usually better. Always check what σ_group implies in the outcome units.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Confusing partial pooling with complete pooling**  \n",
    "A common shortcut is to add group as a fixed effect (no-pooling) or to aggregate within groups before fitting (complete pooling). Both discard information. Partial pooling with `(1|group)` in brms is nearly always the correct choice when groups share a common population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Not examining the random effects variance**  \n",
    "The estimated σ_group tells you how much groups actually differ. A very small σ_group means groups are nearly identical — complete pooling would have been adequate. A very large σ_group means groups differ dramatically — inspect individual group posteriors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Fitting random slopes without checking whether slopes genuinely vary**  \n",
    "Random slopes add complexity. Use LOO-CV to check whether they improve predictive accuracy. If the correlation between random intercepts and slopes is estimated with very wide uncertainty, there is insufficient data to estimate it — use `(1 + nitrate || catchment)` (double bar: uncorrelated) or drop random slopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Not accounting for hierarchical structure in study design**  \n",
    "If sites are nested within catchments and observations are nested within sites, both levels need to be modelled. Ignoring a level of nesting leads to pseudoreplication and incorrect standard errors — even in a Bayesian model.\n",
