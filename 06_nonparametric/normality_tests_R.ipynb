    "\n",
    "**1. Using normality tests to decide whether to run a parametric test**  \n",
    "This is the most common misuse. With small n, tests have low power and fail to detect real non-normality. With large n, they reject perfectly adequate data. Decision should be based on Q-Q plot inspection and subject-matter knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Testing the raw data instead of model residuals**  \n",
    "For linear models and ANOVA, normality of the raw data is not required — normality of the residuals is. A skewed predictor distribution is fine as long as the residuals are approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Treating a non-significant Shapiro-Wilk as proof of normality**  \n",
    "A non-significant Shapiro-Wilk only means you failed to detect non-normality — not that the data are normal. With small n, this test has almost no power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Applying Shapiro-Wilk to n > 2000**  \n",
    "`shapiro.test()` is limited to n ≤ 5000 in R and becomes overly sensitive beyond n ≈ 2000. For large n, use Anderson-Darling or, better, rely entirely on Q-Q plots — at large n, the CLT makes normality largely irrelevant anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Not checking both tails on the Q-Q plot**  \n",
    "Heavy-tailed distributions produce a characteristic S-shape on Q-Q plots — both ends curve away from the reference line. A quick glance at only the middle of the plot will miss this. Always examine both tails carefully.\n",
